# Dynamic-Food-Menu
The Dynamic Food Menu project is designed to showcase a predefined menu that updates automatically depending on the current day. This project leverages JavaScript's Date object to determine the current day and display the corresponding menu. It's a lightweight and user-friendly solution for meal planning and scheduling.
